# How to submit

<!-- We will publish the instructions here and in the Contest's Google Group in the fall. -->

To submit your visualization (images and/or animations), please pack it into a ZIP or .tar.gz file (if you
have multiple files) and upload your file to a file-sharing service such as Dropbox, Google Drive,
https://transfer.sh, or [Nextcloud](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Nextcloud) (if you have an Alliance
account) and {{<a "https://forms.gle/js88XwQdvczW357NA" "use this form">}} to send us the link to the file.

For videos, please use either MPEG-4, H.264, or H.265 codecs, not the older AVI format. Please include the
description of your workflow (or any related script) so that we could reproduce your visualization on our
side. If you want to include a text description of your submission, please add it to your ZIP or .tar.gz file
in any format, e.g. plain text or PDF.

Once we receive your submission, we will send you a confirmation email.
