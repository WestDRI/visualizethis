<font size="5"> 2023 *Visualize This!* Contest: two datasets </font>

<!-- *The 2021 IEEE SciVis Contest is dedicated to creating novel approaches and state-of-the-art visualizations to assist -->
<!-- domain scientists to better understand the convection processes in the Earth's mantle. Contest participants will be -->
<!-- invited to present at the special SciVis Contest session at IEEE Vis 2021 on October 23 - 28, 2021, and the winning -->
<!-- team will be invited to submit a full journal article (with an expedited review process) to IEEE Computer Graphics and -->
<!-- Applications (CG&A) Journal. The contest is sponsored by [IEEE Vis](http://ieeevis.org) and -->
<!-- [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca).* -->

*In this year's Contest you can work on one of two datasets.*

# Halloween storm over Eastern Canada

The research group of {{<a "https://alejandro-diluca.uqam.ca" "Alejandro Di Luca">}} (Université du Québec à
Montréal) provided the first dataset. The data come from a numerical simulation of a storm over Eastern Canada
during Halloween 2019.

The animation below covers six days from October 31st to November 5th, 2019. The 3D volume features the
distribution of clouds (white), rain (green to cyan), and ice crystals (yellow) in the atmosphere, whereas the
2D surface at the bottom shows the snow accumulation on the ground. The 3D variables are also displayed in the
two projections, along the x- and y-axes, to highlight the vertical distribution of the three variables.

The main challenge in this dataset is to show the overlapping distributions of several 3D variables, ideally
(but no necessarily!) in the same visualization.

# Normalized difference vegetation index

The second dataset was provided by the research team of {{<a
"https://biology.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/michael-j-noonan" "Michael Noonan">}} (University of British Columbia
at Okanagan). They compiled approximately 20 years of openly-available remotely sensed NDVI data at the global
scale. NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) is a measure of greenness, widely used to measure the
ecosystem productivity.
