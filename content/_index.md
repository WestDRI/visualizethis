<font size="5"> 2023 *Visualize This!* Contest: two datasets </font>

<!-- *The 2021 IEEE SciVis Contest is dedicated to creating novel approaches and state-of-the-art visualizations to assist -->
<!-- domain scientists to better understand the convection processes in the Earth's mantle. Contest participants will be -->
<!-- invited to present at the special SciVis Contest session at IEEE Vis 2021 on October 23 - 28, 2021, and the winning -->
<!-- team will be invited to submit a full journal article (with an expedited review process) to IEEE Computer Graphics and -->
<!-- Applications (CG&A) Journal. The contest is sponsored by [IEEE Vis](http://ieeevis.org) and -->
<!-- [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca).* -->



Now in its 6th year, *Visualize This!* is a Canada-wide competition that aims to celebrate the innovative ways
visualization can help researchers explore datasets and answer important scientific questions. *Visualize
This!* is your chance to challenge your creativity, experiment with new visualization tools, and contribute to
the growth of data visualization in Canada!

This year's *Visualize This!* Contest is hosted by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada and its regional
partners. Together with the Alliance's National Visualization Team, we want to bring your creative
visualization ideas and workflows to life and make them accessible to all Canadian researchers!

<!-- WestGrid, SciNet, SHARCNET, and Calcul Québec -->

*In this year's Contest you can work on one of the two datasets below.* To participate in the challenge,
please [register your interest](google form).

# Dataset 1: Halloween storm over Eastern Canada

The research group of {{<a "https://alejandro-diluca.uqam.ca" "Alejandro Di Luca">}} (Université du Québec à
Montréal) provided the first dataset. The data come from a numerical simulation of a storm over Eastern Canada
during Halloween 2019.

The animation below covers six days from October 31st to November 5th, 2019. The 3D volume features the
distribution of clouds (white), rain (green to cyan), and ice crystals (yellow) in the atmosphere, whereas the
2D surface at the bottom shows the snow accumulation on the ground. The 3D variables are also displayed in the
two projections, along the x- and y-axes, to highlight the relative vertical distribution of the three
variables.

cyan), and ice crystals (yellow) over 6 days starting with the storm on October 31, 2019.</font> </p>

The main challenge in this dataset is to show the overlapping distributions of several 3D variables, ideally
(but no necessarily!) in the same visualization.

# Dataset 2: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)

The second dataset was provided by the research team of {{<a
"https://biology.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/michael-j-noonan" "Michael Noonan">}} (University of British Columbia
at Okanagan). They compiled approximately 20 years of openly-available remotely sensed NDVI data at the global
scale. NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) is a measure of greenness, widely used to measure the
ecosystem productivity.

# Terms

Please only use open-source tools and libraries in the Contest, so that anyone can reproduce your solution
without having to pay for commercial / proprietary tools. Two commonly used 3D visualization tools are {{<a
"https://www.paraview.org" "ParaView">}} and {{<a "https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website" "VisIt">}}, but
you are free to use any open-source package or library or any programming language -- there are many tools
readily available for visualizing these data. What one can do with these tools is really limited only by their
imagination.

Your submission in the Contest (both images/movies and the workflow) will be published under a <a
