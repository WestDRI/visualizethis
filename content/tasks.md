These guidelines are just suggestions, not the instructions. We would like to see unusual approaches and novel
visualizations of these datasets. Please experiment with your tool of choice, and don't be afraid to try
something new!

*Depending on the dataset you work on, please read the corresponding section below.*

# Halloween storm over Eastern Canada

1. Show time-dependent distributions of clouds, rain and ice particles in the atmosphere over the three days,
   both relative to topography and to each other.
1. Show how these distributions affect the land snow cover and the sea surface pressure.

# Normalized difference vegetation index

1. Visualize how both the mean NDVI and its variance change over space and/or time.
1. Demonstrate the mean-variance relationship and how it changes in space and time.
1. Show the importance of variance, and also the importance of **not** assuming that it is constant over time
   and space. How stochastic (unpredictable) are the ecosystems?
1. In a 3D visualization it would be interesting to see the relation between both NDVI variables and
   elevation. One could easily plot, e.g. the mean NDVI vs. elevation, e.g. as a scatter plot, but it would be
   interesting to display this relationship in real space.
1. Animations and perhaps interactive visualizations. We would also welcome more artistic submissions, e.g. a
   flyover above BC.



<!-- 1. How does the relationship between the mean NDVI and its variance vary spatially? We would like to see -->
<!--    different ways of representing this relationship. -->



<!-- Not sure what you mean by "projected". If you referring to projection onto a sphere (if their rendering is 3D) -->
<!-- or a cartographic projection (if 2D), then we’ll leave it to participants. The goal of the contest is to see -->
<!-- unusual ideas and approaches, so I’d rather not limit to a specific view. -->





<!-- question to Stefano: -->
<!-- - how is V(NDVI) defined exactly? Is it spatial or temporal variance? -->
