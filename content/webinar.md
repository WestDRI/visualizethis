<font size="+3">2023 *Visualize This!* Contest</font>


Last Friday (Sep-15) we launched the *Visualize This!* Contest.

### Now in its 6th year

- {{<a "https://visualizethis.netlify.app" "2023:">}} Halloween storm over Eastern Canada <ins>and</ins> the
  Normalized difference vegetation index
- {{<a "https://scivis2021.netlify.app" "2020-2021:">}} Earth's Mantle Convection
  {{< figure src="https://ccvis.netlify.app/ieee2021.png" title="In 2020-2021 we partnered with IEEE Vis to host the international 2021 SciVis Contest" >}}
- {{<a "https://scivis2021.netlify.app/2019" "2019:">}} Incompressible transitional air flow over a wind turbine
  section <ins>or</ins> bring your own data

### Who are we?

We are the Alliance's {{<a "https://ccvis.netlify.app/about" "National Visualization Team">}} composed of HPC
analysts from the Alliance's regional partners (ACENET, Calcul Québec, Compute Ontario) and universities in
Western Canada (SFU, Univ of Alberta, Univ of Calgary).
- Hosted by [the Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca) and its regional / institutional partners

### Why we host these contests

1. **Train**: popularize and teach open-source software visualization tools and techniques that researchers can
   apply to their own data. We regularly teach visualization workshops and courses, and we find that a
   visualization contest is a perfect venue for early-career researchers to learn these tools and sharpen
   their data analysis skills.
1. **Outreach**: tell all Canadian academic researchers about our visualization support, including
   *support@tech.alliancecan.ca* and your local/regional HPC support.
1. **Learn**: see novel visualization ideas, learn from you.

### Who can participate

Targeting primarily graduate students and postdocs from Canadian universities, but anyone can participate
irrespective of their affiliation or career stage.

### Contest terms

Please read our [Contest terms](/#contest-terms) before sending us your work.
1. Only use open-source (not proprietary or commercial) tools so that anyone can reproduce your visualization.
1. Your submission may be published on our website and in other communication materials, with all credits
   preserved.

### Datasets

You can work on one of two datasets:
- both datasets contain *Canadian geospatial data*: one from a numerical simulation, and the other compiled
  from several empirical sources
- both are available for downloading now
- both can be visualized on personal computers (no need for HPC)


1. Simulation of a storm over Eastern Canada
- more difficult, involves multiple overlapping 3D scalar fields
- data kindly provided by Alejandro Di Luca and François Roberge from l'Université du Québec à Montréal
- simulation was conducted using the Alliance's Narval cluster

2. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over BC throughout 2022
- less complex, almost 2D data
- data kindly provided by Michael Noonan and Stefano Mezzini from the University of British Columbia at Okanagan
