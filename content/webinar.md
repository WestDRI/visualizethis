<font size="+3">2023 *Visualize This!* Contest</font>

Last Friday (Sep-15) we launched the *Visualize This!* Contest.

### Who are we?

We are the Alliance's {{<a "https://ccvis.netlify.app/about" "National Visualization Team">}} comprised of HPC
analysts from the Alliance's regional partners (ACENET, Calcul Qu√©bec, Compute Ontario) and universities in
Western Canada (SFU, Univ of Alberta, Univ of Calgary).
- Hosted by [the Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca) and its regional / institutional partners

### Why we host these contests

1. **Train**: popularize and teach open-source software visualization tools and techniques that researchers can
   apply to their own data. We regularly teach visualization workshops and courses, and we find that a
   visualization contest is a perfect venue for early-career researchers to learn these tools and sharpen
   their data analysis skills.
1. **Outreach**: tell all Canadian academic researchers about our visualization support, including
   *support@tech.alliancecan.ca* and your local/regional HPC support.
1. **Learn**: see novel visualization ideas, learn from you.

### Who can participate

Targeting primarily graduate students and postdocs from Canadian universities, but anyone can participate
irrespective of their affiliation or career stage.

### Contest terms

Please read our [Contest terms](/#contest-terms) before sending us your work.
1. Only use open-source (not proprietary or commercial) tools so that anyone can reproduce your visualization.
1. Your submission may be published on our website and in other communication materials, with all credits
   preserved.

<u>Don't be afraid to experiment!</u> With 3D visualization I usually find the interactive data exploration
process a lot of fun, and the more you play with the data, the more ideas you typically have. We expect that
most participants will be absolute beginners with 3D visualization, so the idea is to learn in the process.

### Datasets

You can work on one of two datasets:
- both datasets contain *Canadian geospatial data*: one from a numerical simulation, and the other compiled
  from several empirical sources
- both are available for downloading now
- both can be visualized on personal computers (no need for HPC)

1. Simulation of a storm over Eastern Canada
- more difficult, involves multiple overlapping 3D scalar fields
- data kindly provided by Alejandro Di Luca and Fran√ßois Roberge from l'Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al
- simulation was conducted using the Alliance's Narval cluster

### Let's take a look at the data!

# Dataset 1: simulation of a storm over Eastern Canada

Let's load the data in Python:

- len(data.time) = 24 inside each 3D file
- (rlat, rlon) are *the coordinates in the rotated grid* used by the model
- the geographical coordinates lon(rlat, rlon) and lat(rlat, rlon) are inside the data files
- type(data.lon.values)
- data.MPQR.values.shape = (24, 16, 1060, 1330)

Let's check an example of a complete workflow `a14.py` in ParaView. This file is not shared with the participants.

Let's create a flat topography file in ParaView:

1. load the land-sea mask MG(rlat,rlon) from `pm2015090100_00000000p.nc`, selecting (rlat,rlon) variables
2. load the topographical elevation ME(rlat,rlon) from `dm2015090100_00000000p.nc`, selecting  (rlat,rlon) variables
3. apply Append Attributes to both
4. apply Calculator: elevation = MG*ME
5. apply the Programmable Filter
Output Type = vtkImageData
```py
ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()
elevation = inputs[0].PointData["elevation"]

output.SetOrigin(0., 0., 0.)
output.SetSpacing(1., 1., 3.)
output.SetDimensions(ext[1]-ext[0]+1, ext[3]-ext[2]+1, ext[5]-ext[4]+1)
output.SetExtent(ext)
output.AllocateScalars(vtk.VTK_FLOAT, 1)

vtk_data_array = vtk.util.numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(elevation, deep=True, array_type=vtk.VTK_FLOAT)
vtk_data_array.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
vtk_data_array.SetName("elevation")
output.GetPointData().SetScalars(vtk_data_array)
```
6. apply Threshold to throw away 0<elevation<0.1
7. last object | Save Data as `topo.pvd`
8. optionally apply Warp by Scalar coeff=0.003

You can visualize everything in curved / spherical coordinates. Here is an example for a 3D array:

1. load the mass mixing ratio of cloud `MPQC(time,pres,rlat,rlon)` from `dp2015090100_20191101d.nc`, selecting
   (pres,rlat,rlon) variables and using `vertical scale = 1` and `vertical bias = 1e4` to force a narrow
   radial section
2. try Surface &nbsp;ü°í&nbsp; can't see anything ...
3. try Volume representation &nbsp;ü°í&nbsp; *very, very slow* ... trying to do ray tracing in curved geometry
3. Isosurface might work in this geometry &nbsp;ü°í&nbsp; try a range on a log scale

If instead you prefer to transition to a flat geometry (*much faster* in Volume representation), here is how
you could do it with a 3D array:

1. load the mass mixing ratio of cloud `MPQC(time,pres,rlat,rlon)` from `dp2015090100_20191101d.nc`, selecting
   (pres,rlat,rlon) variables; vertical scale/bias are not important here
2. apply the Programmable Filter
Output Type = vtkImageData
```py
ext = inputs[0].GetExtent()
mpqr = inputs[0].PointData["MPQR"]

output.SetOrigin(0., 0., 0.)
output.SetSpacing(1., 1., 9.)
output.SetDimensions(ext[1]-ext[0]+1, ext[3]-ext[2]+1, ext[5]-ext[4]+1)
output.SetExtent(ext)
output.AllocateScalars(vtk.VTK_FLOAT, 1)

vtk_data_array = vtk.util.numpy_support.numpy_to_vtk(mpqr, deep=True, array_type=vtk.VTK_FLOAT)
vtk_data_array.SetNumberOfComponents(1)
vtk_data_array.SetName("rain")
output.GetPointData().SetScalars(vtk_data_array)
```
- apply Contour at 0.0001
- make all white
- also show the Volume representation

### Plotting all timesteps inside a single NetCDF file

In the previous visualization, let's go back to Contour at 1.e-4. Also show the outline. Use "Play" button to
play it back. How can you save this animation.

<u>Traditional approach:</u>

1. File | Save Animation... as PNG images
2. use [*ffmpeg* command-line utility](https://ffmpeg.org) to merge them into a movie at let's say 10fps

<u>Scripting approach:</u>
1. File | Save State... as a Python code `animOneDay.py`
1. You can even test it via File | Load State... to make sure everything looks good
1. Edit this Python code:  
    a. look for the line with `dp2015090100_20191031dnc = NetCDFReader`  
    b. rename `dp2015090100_20191031dnc` to `data` everywhere in the script  
    c. remove any existing `SaveScreenshot`  
    d. add the following near the end of your script:
```py
time = data.TimestepValues
print(time)
for t in time:
    print("processing step", t)
    data.UpdatePipeline(t)
    renderView1.ViewTime = t
    SaveScreenshot('/path/to/frame%04d'%(t)+'.png', renderView1, ImageResolution=[1920, 1080])
```
4. Run the script:
```sh
pvpython animOneDay.py
```

### Challenge: visualize multiple 3D fields and their relative positions

- use different colour maps for different variables
- avoid overlapping and too much data in one plot
- use different representations for different variables

Check out [Tasks](../tasks).

# Dataset 2: NDVI over BC

Presenter: play back `~/Documents/09-visualizeThisWebinar/mu_both.mp4`. This file is not shared with the
participants.

Let's load the CSV data in Python:

- each row is a data point, no underlying mesh

Let's load the VTK data in ParaView

1. each point has three variables: elev, NDVI $\mu$ , and its variance $\sigma_2$
1. use Point Gaussian representation with a plain circle, adjust radius
1. colour by NDVI
1. switch to the blue-to-brown-to-green NDVI colour map

Let's load the CSV data in ParaView -- this takes a while. Pass the data through the Table To Points filter.

### Suggestions

Check out [Tasks](../tasks).

<!-- Please note that there are some artifacts in the data related to a model fit, e.g. if you look at *elevation*, -->
<!-- there is one data point above 7km. You can either remove this point, or ignore it in your analysis -- it -->
<!-- should not affect the visualization part. -->
